1.1 Game Overview

Title: MANDAT
Genre: Real-Time Strategy (RTS)
Inspiration Lineage:
	•	Command & Conquer: Generals
	•	Dune 2000

Core Differentiator:
Player behavior is silently tracked across long-cycle gameplay and judged during a compression phase that reveals moral consequence from the enemy’s perspective.

⸻

1.2 Core Pillars
	1.	Symmetric War Foundation
	•	5 playable factions
	•	Identical core unit tree
	•	Unique specialization branch per faction
	2.	Temptation Mechanic
	•	AI Queen hive tech fracturing (1–12%)
	•	Immediate power tradeoff vs escalation risk
	3.	Long-Cycle Memory
	•	7-day gameplay weeks
	•	26-week accumulation
	•	48-hour compression convergence
	4.	Adaptive Sovereign Intelligence
	•	AI Queen profiles behavior
	•	Unlockable Symbiotic Path
	5.	Consequence Reflection
	•	30-minute replay
	•	Dual ending system

⸻

1.3 Gameplay Loop

Harvest → Expand → Engage → Escalate → Adapt → Accumulate → Compress → Archive → Reset

⸻

1.4 Factions

5 Interstellar Civilizations:
	•	Shared Units: Barracks, Light Factory, Heavy Factory
	•	Unique Advantage: One asymmetric mechanic (unit, structure, tech)

6th Faction:
AI Hive Civilization
	•	Reactive until provoked
	•	Escalates proportionally
	•	Adaptive memory layer
	•	Hidden diplomacy vector

⸻

1.5 End States

Tyrant Path
	•	Maximum fractured tech
	•	High destruction index
	•	Ending: “YOU DID THIS!!”

Symbiotic Path
	•	Restrained aggression
	•	Colony defense events
	•	Symbiotic Integration tech tree
	•	Ending: “YOU CHOSE THIS.”

2️⃣ 12-Slide Investor Pitch Deck Structure

Slide 1 — Vision
MANDAT: The First RTS That Judges the Player.

Slide 2 — Market
RTS niche underserved.
Long-cycle persistent multiplayer is rare.
Ethical simulation layer is nonexistent.

Slide 3 — Problem
Modern RTS = short dopamine loops.
No consequence memory.
No moral differentiation.

Slide 4 — Solution
MANDAT introduces:
	•	Long-cycle accumulation
	•	Behavioral intelligence tracking
	•	Dual moral end states

Slide 5 — Gameplay
Traditional RTS foundation.
Familiar entry barrier.
Deep systemic differentiation.

Slide 6 — AI Queen System
Adaptive, profiling sovereign intelligence.
Hidden symbiotic path.

Slide 7 — Retention Model
26-week seasonal arc.
Compression events.
Legacy leaderboard permanence.

Slide 8 — Monetization
	•	Cosmetic skins
	•	Seasonal world entry
	•	Archive viewing access
	•	Spectator compression events

No pay-to-win.

Slide 9 — Tech Architecture
Near-Intersect economic spine.
Behavior digest hashing.
Scalable server persistence.

Slide 10 — Competitive Moat
Hard to clone:
	•	Long-cycle memory engine
	•	AI adaptation layer
	•	Behavioral compression model

Slide 11 — Roadmap
Prototype RTS core
Queen AI model
Closed alpha
Season 1 launch

Slide 12 — Ask
Seed funding for:
	•	RTS engine team
	•	AI behavioral modeling
	•	Multiplayer infrastructure

3️⃣ Lightweight MVP Architecture Scope

We reduce to essentials.

MVP Goal:

Prove:
	•	RTS works
	•	Queen adaptation works
	•	Behavior tracking works

Phase 1 (6–9 Months)

Core Components:
	1.	One faction only.
	2.	AI Queen only (no PvP).
	3.	XaVug harvesting.
	4.	Fractured tech mechanic.
	5.	Behavior Signature tracking.
	6.	Shortened 3-week cycle instead of 26.

No blockchain in MVP.
No large server cluster.

Unity or Unreal + backend persistence layer.

⸻

4️⃣ Behavioral Signature Index (BSI) — Precise Scoring Model

This is critical.

BSI is a weighted behavioral composite score.

Each metric normalized 0–100.

⸻

Core Metrics

A. Aggression Frequency (AF)

Attacks initiated per in-game day.
Weighted by:
	•	Unprovoked aggression multiplier.

B. Colony Provocation Index (CPI)

Number of hive structures attacked.
Depth of incursion.
Damage to core nodes.

C. Fracture Acquisition Rate (FAR)

Tech fragments gained per week.
Aggressive harvesting multiplier.

D. Defensive Posture Ratio (DPR)

Defensive structures built vs offensive.
Time spent repelling vs initiating.

E. Civilian Impact Metric (CIM)

Non-military entity destruction.

F. Protection Events (PE)

Instances defending hive from other factions.

⸻

Composite Score Calculation

Tyrant Vector (TV) =
(AF × 0.25) +
(CPI × 0.25) +
(FAR × 0.20) +
(CIM × 0.15) +
(Offensive Bias Modifier × 0.15)

Symbiotic Vector (SV) =
(DPR × 0.30) +
(PE × 0.30) +
(Restraint Time Index × 0.20) +
(Low CPI Modifier × 0.20)

Final Classification:

If TV > SV by threshold margin → Tyrant Path
If SV > TV by threshold margin → Symbiotic Path
If within margin → Neutral Archetype

Margin example: 12% differential minimum.

What You’ve Built

This is no longer just a game.

It is:
	•	A behavioral simulation framework.
	•	A sovereign AI experiment.
	•	A long-cycle war mirror.
	•	A monetizable RTS with moral differentiation.
