# Value & Market Sale (Non-Binding)

This document is **not** a valuation and does **not** claim a market price.

Any purchase price, partnership terms, or licensing value for **RagTuff** and **Near-Intersect** is negotiated and depends on **verifiable delivery** (mainnet proofs, adoption, audits, and clean IP/legal positioning). Values can range widely—from minimal to material—based on execution and demand.

## How serious buyers typically evaluate value
1. **Proof of execution**  
   Working mainnet deployments + transaction receipts + reproducible builds.
2. **Risk profile**  
   Security posture, test coverage, threat model, operational runbook, and third-party audit readiness.
3. **Adoption & distribution**  
   Users/tokens created, integrations, partners, community traction, and retention.
4. **Business model**  
   Licensing structure, enterprise support offering, fees, and revenue or clear revenue path.
5. **IP cleanliness**  
   Clear ownership, licensing terms, contributor rights, trademarks/naming clarity, and no hidden encumbrances.

## What can be offered (deal structures)
- **IP license**: RagTuff “law layer / invariant constitution” + usage rights + compliance requirements.
- **Acquisition**: Near-Intersect repo + brand + documentation + audit package + operational handoff.
- **Strategic partnership**: co-development + revenue share + governance/controls.

## Milestones that measurably increase value
- Factory v0: **create_token + registry + event proofs** with **OIM mandatory**.
- One **end-to-end mainnet creation** demonstrated (created contract is callable and verifiable).
- Doctrine + profile generation docs locked and consistent across repos.
- Audit-ready package: invariants, tests, threat model, runbook, change-control.
